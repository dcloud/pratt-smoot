# Audio on USB flash drives for Digital Talking-Book Players

## Background

The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) created digital talking-book (DTB) players that are based on common computer technologies, USB and flash memory in particular. These players have two USB ports, one made for flash memory in a cartridge form factor and one "normal" USB port (typically on the right side of the player). The cartridge port supposedly only supports a non-standard USB interface, but the "normal" port is standard USB.
