Resources around materials for the blind (talking books, etc.)

## Plans

The current generation of digital talking book players understand common digital audio formats and so can be used to play back podcasts and other audio content. Simple playback involves placing audio files in a `audio+podcasts` folder on a USB drive, and plugging that USB drive into a port on the side of the player. I'm hoping to store detailed instructions on how to do that, and build some tools to make the process easier.

### ToDo
 - Simple podcast instructions
 - Helper tool(s) for podcasts on Flash drives.
 - Tools for [ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/daisy/Z39-86-2002.html) (aka DAISY 3) or DAISY 2.02 book formats
